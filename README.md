This assignment is being handed in after originally being "skipped." Now that I am more confident with my coding skills I wanted to attempt to get the skip back. In this workday scheduler you will be able to save your tasks and upon the appropriate time of day the color of timeblow row should turn green, grey, or red based on future, present, or past deadlines for the tasks.

This assignment uses javascript and jQuery API to show the time with Moment.js.
